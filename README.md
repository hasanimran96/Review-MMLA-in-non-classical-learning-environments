# Review-MMLA-in-non-classical-learning-environments
Multimodal Learning Analytics is part of Learning Analytics in the field of Educational Data Mining and Academic Analytics. MMLA gained pop-ularity when researchers wanted to study the physical environment with the dig-ital environment. This opened many new possibilities to research as now one could consider various environments such as the classroom, the studentâ€™s own room, and even virtual environments. Collecting data in such environments was a new challenge and required an array of sensors. Having just one sensor to cap-ture all this versatile data would seem like the ideal solution. On top of that, if we were to consider collaborative devices, we would need sensors capable of col-lecting multiple types of data from multiple users simultaneously. In this paper, an analysis of using the Microsoft Kinect sensor as a replacement sensor for video, audio, motions, gestures, and emotions is considered. Further, we also consider the possibility of using the Kinect sensor with collaborative devices to gather data. One such device that we have considered is the multitouch table. Some ideas and benefits to using the Kinect with the multitouch table are also discussed. Finally, a brief overview of using the Kinect in virtual environments is also discussed and the possibility of having collaboration in virtual environ-ments is also explored.
